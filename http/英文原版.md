HTTP are the four letters at the beginning of your URLs, right? That’s all you really have to know about it to build for the web, but, just like [understanding binary](https://raddevon.com/articles/the-basics-of-binary-and-other-number-systems-for-web-developers/), it can help you understand problems you otherwise wouldn’t. It’s not required material, but it makes you a more well-rounded developer.  

Since it’s the primary communication protocol our software will be using, let’s learn a little about HTTP!


## What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. That’s a set of rules (protocol) for sending and receiving (transfer) web pages (hypertext). Even though it’s still called HTTP, it’s now used for sending lots of things besides hypertext — for example, JSON and images.


## How does HTTP work?

HTTP communication happens between a client and a server. The client makes the HTTP request, and the server responds to it. Your web browser is an HTTP client. When you visit a web page, your browser sends an HTTP request to a server which sends a response. It’s (almost) that simple.


Actually, a single web page is usually comprised of multiple requests. What usually happens is a request is made for some HTML, and the server responds with the HTML. The browser starts rendering the HTML and makes additional requests for any other resources it needs to render the page — like Javascript files, CSS files, and images.


## Parts of a Request

Here’s what a raw request to RadDevon.com for the home page looks like:


```
GET / HTTP/2
Host: raddevon.com
User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
Accept: */*
```

When you type raddevon.com into your address bar and press return, your browser sends this request to my host. Here are the parts:


* ```GET``` – The request method. It tells the server what the request is intended to do. This request wants the server to send back some data. MDN has a nice request method reference.  


* ```/``` – The resource we’re requesting. Since the homepage is at the root of the server, that’s the resource we’re requesting here.


* ```HTTP/2``` – The protocol. This particular request is made using version 2 of HTTP.
